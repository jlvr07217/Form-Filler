# Form-Filler
Python Script to automate some paperwork in my office job at Louisiana Tech.
Important Notes:
- The program will fill all fields such as names, addresses, emails, etc.
- Current bugs: The program will not fill out dates on the PDF forms

How to Use:
- Use an excel file (This has not been tested with google sheets)
- When you you run the main.py, it will prompt you for the filename (you can simply type the file name if it is in the same directory as the program itself. If not, type the file path)
- Next, the program will prompt you for the form you want to fill out (pdf), type the file name (if in same directory) or file path
- A filled pdf form will appear in the Form Filler Directory

Future plans:
- Fix the fill in dates bug
- Implement a GUI for the scipt
- Implement a feature for the user to open file explorer and select the excel file as an input
- Implement compatibility for google sheets
